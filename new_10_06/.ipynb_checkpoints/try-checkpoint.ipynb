      "\n",
      "Kerr frequency combs, due to their unique properties such as equidistant frequency spacing and strong correlation of carrier fluctuations, offer significant promise for high-capacity optical communications through wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). However, despite their advantages, there are certain limitations when using Kerr frequency combs as laser carriers for WDM optical communications. This discussion will outline these limitations systematically.\n",

      "## 1. Phase Noise and Stability Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "### High Phase Noise\n",
      "One of the primary challenges of Kerr frequency combs is the presence of high phase noise, which arises from the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics within the microcavities. This phase noise can degrade the performance of high-speed data transmission systems, as it leads to increased bit error rates and reduced signal quality. The phase noise is particularly problematic in dense WDM systems where precise frequency stability is critical for maintaining the integrity of individual channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Frequency Drift\n",
      "Kerr frequency combs may experience frequency drift over time, which can affect the stability of the comb lines. This drift can result from temperature variations, mechanical vibrations, or changes in the refractive index of the microcavity material. Such instabilities necessitate sophisticated stabilization techniques to maintain the comb's performance over extended periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Limited Bandwidth and Channel Count\n",
      "\n",
      "### Narrow Bandwidth\n",
      "While Kerr frequency combs can span broad bandwidths, the actual usable bandwidth for WDM applications is often limited by the physical constraints of the microcavity design. Achieving a balance between the number of comb lines and the bandwidth of each line is crucial for optimizing the system's spectral efficiency. A narrower bandwidth can limit the number of channels that can be effectively utilized in a WDM system.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scalability Issues\n",
      "Scaling up the number of comb lines to accommodate a larger number of WDM channels presents technical challenges. As the number of lines increases, the complexity of managing and stabilizing the comb grows, potentially leading to increased power consumption and system complexity. This scalability issue remains a significant hurdle for deploying Kerr frequency combs in high-capacity communication networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Receiver-Side Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "### Receiver Complexity\n",
      "Although Kerr frequency combs simplify the transmitter side by providing multiple equidistant carriers, the receiver side still faces challenges. The need for efficient demodulation and synchronization of the comb lines requires advanced signal processing capabilities. Implementing these functionalities in a compact, low-power, and cost-effective manner remains a formidable task, particularly for large-scale deployments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Dependence on External Lasers\n",
      "Many current implementations of Kerr frequency comb-based WDM systems rely on external cavity lasers (ECLs) as optical local oscillators (LOs) for coherent reception. While this approach provides high performance, it undermines the scalability of the receiver architecture. Developing self-contained, integrated solutions for both the transmitter and receiver remains a key goal for realizing the full potential of Kerr frequency combs in WDM communications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Material and Fabrication Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "### Material Sensitivity\n",
      "The performance of Kerr frequency combs is highly sensitive to the choice of materials and fabrication processes. Variations in material properties, such as refractive index and thermal conductivity, can significantly impact the stability and efficiency of the comb lines. Ensuring consistent performance across large-scale production requires stringent quality control and advanced fabrication techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Fabrication Challenges\n",
      "Fabricating high-quality Kerr frequency comb sources on a chip scale is nontrivial. The integration of microcavities with other photonic components must be done with precision to avoid introducing defects that could degrade the comb's performance. Overcoming these fabrication challenges is essential for achieving widespread adoption of Kerr frequency combs in commercial optical communication systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "While Kerr frequency combs hold great promise for advancing WDM optical communications, they face several limitations that must be addressed to fully realize their potential. Addressing issues related to phase noise, bandwidth, receiver complexity, and material constraints will be crucial in developing robust and scalable solutions for high-capacity optical networks. Continued research and innovation in these areas will be vital for overcoming these limitations and realizing the benefits of Kerr frequency combs in next-generation communication systems.\n"

      "[{'answer': '# Introduction\\n\\nKerr frequency combs have emerged as a promising technology for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical communications, offering the potential to overcome many of the limitations posed by traditional laser arrays. These combs are generated using the Kerr effect in nonlinear microresonators and provide a multitude of equidistant spectral lines that can be modulated individually. However, despite their advantages, there are several limitations associated with Kerr frequency combs when used as laser carriers in WDM systems. This document explores these limitations point by point.', 'docs': [\"Optical carriers for WDM transmission are commonly generated by distributed feedback (DFB) laser arrays. Chip-scale transmitter systems with DFB lasers have been realized on InP substrates, showing potential for simultaneous operation of 40 channels15. However, these approaches cannot be transferred directly to the silicon photonic platform, as combining conventional DFB laser arrays with silicon photonic transmitters would require a multitude of chip-chip interfaces, thereby significantly increasing the packaging effort. Hybrid integration of -v dies on silicon substratesl6 avoids these interfaces, but scalability to large channel counts is still limited by the gain bandwidth of the semiconductor material and by thermal constraints. Moreover, the spectral efficiency of DFB-based transmission systems suffers from the uncertainty of the individual emission frequencies, which is of the order of several gigahertz and requires appropriate guard bands to avoid spectral overlap of neighbouring WDM channels. For dense WDM with a channel spacing of, for example, $25\\\\mathrm{GHz},$ the guard bands consume a significant fraction of the available transmission bandwidth.  \\nThese limitations can be overcome by exploiting optical frequency combs as sources for wDM transmission. Frequency. combs consist of a multitude of equidistant spectral lines, each of which can be modulated individually1,17,1. The inherently constant frequency spacing of the comb lines enables the transmission of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals' or of Nyquist-wDM signals1s with 'closely spaced subcarriers. Frequency combs with line spacings in the gigahertz range can be generated by external modulation of a narrowband continuouswave (c.w.) signal19, by mode-locked lasers based on semiconductor quantum-dot or quantum-dash materials2o, or by exploiting parametric frequency conversion in Kerr-nonlinear high-Q microcavities. In contrast to modulator-based approaches or mode-locked laser diodes, the bandwidth of Kerr combs is neither limited by the achievable modulation depth nor by the gain bandwidth of the active medium. Kerr combs can therefore exhibit bandwidths of hundreds of nanometres21, thereby covering multiple telecommunication bands (such as the $\\\\mathrm{C},\\\\mathrm{L}$ and U bands) with typical line spacings between $10\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ and $100\\\\mathrm{GHz}$\", 'Optical frequency combs possess a notable potential in the Terabit communications area [1]. Kerr comb generation in the nonlinear microcavities [2] is especially promising [3], because it allows creation of the combs with tens of GHz in spacing. However, such combs could also give birth to strong phase noises [4 6], which in turn lead to problems with high speed data transmission. Th eresults of the conducted experiments [7-9] show that it is the Kerr combs that satisfy the serious conditions of the coherent communications, and thus are a promising means for the creation of microscaled transmitters, operating in the Tb/sec range.  \\nOptical means for data transfer with wave division multiplexing (WDM) are usually created with distributed feedback lasers. However, the spectral efficiency of such systems suffers greatly from the individual radiation frequencies indeterminacy, by an order of several GHz, and demands special methods to fight the WDM range overlapping, and these additional bands take up a significant portion of the available transmission bandwidth. These problems could be avoided by employing optical frequency combs as the WDM sources. Optical frequency combs are made out of a multitude of equidistant spectral lines, where each of them can be modulated separately [1, 10-13].', 'Kerr microresonator frequency combs that generate solitons have been utilized in optical trans- receivers1- 10, and they offer several advantages, ranging from increased data capacity in a small footprint to enhanced signal stability11,12. By laser pumping a high- quality- factor microresonator made of a nonlinear medium, the Kerr effect can be utilized to generate an optical frequency comb, where a series of equally spaced optical carriers, or comb lines/modes, within a single optical channel is formed13. The equally spaced coherent comb lines have a narrow linewidth, making them a good candidate to serve as optical carriers in optical transceivers to significantly increase the aggregate data- rate by introducing many parallel communication channels in a WDM scheme14. Furthermore, due to the small footprint of Kerr microresonators, transceivers utilizing such devices can achieve a high areal bandwidth density. The high spectral efficiency offered by Kerr microresonators is particularly beneficial in scenarios where there is a growing demand for high- bandwidth applications, such as AI systems, cloud computing, video streaming, and 5G- XG networks15- 19. Additionally, Kerr soliton microcombs are typically resilient to external perturbations and can enhance the overall stability of the transmitted signals20, which leads to improved system performance and higher transmission reliability.  \\nIn a WDM transmitter, carriers generated within the multi- carrier source are typically separated, individually modulated, and combined to form the transmitter output. Figure 1a shows a simplified block  \\ndiagram of a WDM transceiver that utilizes a Kerr microcomb as the multi- carrier light source, where a demultiplexer (DeMux) placed after the Kerr frequency comb separates the carriers, effectively forming a multi- port multi- wavelength light source. Given the per- carrier data- rate and comb line spacing, the DeMux needs to be designed to provide adequate isolation between different channels to avoid channel- to- channel crosstalk and data corruption. Once the separated carriers are individually modulated, they are combined back together into a single waveguide using a multiplexer (Mux) block. At the receiving end, a similar DeMux block is utilized to separate the modulated carriers before they are delivered to the demodulators for data retrieval.', 'The present capacity increase of optical networks relies mainly on wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and coherent transmission. The associated transceiver systems need to be cost-efficient and compact while featuring low power consumption. These requirements can be partially fulfilled by high-density integration of IQ modulators and coherent receivers, e.g., on the silicon photonic platform1. Scalability of the associated optical sources, however, is still an issue, notably for transmission of tens of Tbit/s, where hundreds of individually stabilized lasers are usually used?. At the transmitter, these limitations may be overcome by frequency comb sources3, in particular when realized as chip-scale devices4. Carriers derived from such comb sources are equidistant in frequency so that guard bands between WDM channels can be minimized. Moreover, the strong correlation of the carrier frequency fluctuations enables efficient compensation of nonlinear fiber impairments5. We have recently demonstrated that Kerr soliton frequency combs represent a particularly attractive option6, enabling transmission of a total data stream of 50.2 Tbit/s on 176 carriers over a distance of $75~{\\\\mathsf{k m}}$ . Still, with a few exceptions at comparatively low data rates?, all these experiments rely on external cavity lasers (ECL) as optical local oscillators (LO) for coherent reception, leaving the scalability problem at the receiver Iargely unsolved.  \\nIn this work we report on the first massively parallel WDM transmission experiment using a frequency comb as a multi-wavelength LO for coherent reception. We use a pair of silicon nitride (Si3N4) Kerr soliton comb sources8,9 with nearly identical line spacing to provide both the WDM carriers and the LO tones. Using 99 WDM channels in the C and L bands, we transmit an aggregate data stream of 34.6 Tbit/s over $75~{\\\\mathsf{k m}}$ of standard single-mode fiber (SsMF). We further show that the performance achieved with the soliton Kerr frequency comb as multi-wavelength LO compares well to the one achieved with a tuneable high-quality ECL LO.', 'Frequency comb generators (FCG) have emerged as light sources for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) communications [1-10]. A frequency comb consists of a multitude of inherently equidistant spectral lines, hence relaxing the requirements for inter-channel guard bands and avoiding individual frequency control of each line as needed in conventional schemes that use arrays of independent lasers. This advantage also applies to the WDM receiver, where an array of discrete local oscillators (LO) might be replaced by a single FCG [5,9,10]. Using an LO comb for parallel coherent reception of WDM signals further facilitates joint digital signal processing of the channels and can thus reduce receiver complexity and increase phase-noise tolerance [11,12]. Moreover, parallel coherent reception with frequency-locked LO tones might even allow to reconstruct the time-domain waveform of the overall wDM signal and thus permit compensation of impairments caused by optical nonlinearities of the transmission fiber [13].  \\nAmong the various FCG concepts, chip-scale devices are of particular interest [4-9,14-19] Combined with advanced photonic integrated circuits for modulation, multiplexing, routing, and reception of data signals, chip-scale FCG offer a path towards highly scalable, compact and energy-efficient WDM transceivers that can offer multi-terabit transmission capacities per fiber. However, chip-scale FCG are also subject to specific limitations when compared to arrays of individual tunable lasers [20] or to discrete-element comb generators that rely, e.g., on highly nonlinear optical fibers [1-3]. In particular, the tones of a chip-scale FCG usually feature comparatively low optical power, in some cases combined with limited optical carrier-to-noise ratio (OCNR). For large line counts, optical amplifiers are then needed to boost the optical power prior to modulation, which might further decrease the OCNR. In addition, comb lines generated by chip-scale devices may exhibit pronounced spectral power variations and thus often require spectral flattening, which can lead to further degradation of the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). However, while these aspects can lead to severe performance limitations, a quantitative analysis of the impact of OCNR limitations and line-to-line power variations on the transmission performance of comb-based WDM transceivers is still lacking.']}, {'answer': '## 1. Phase Noise and Stability Issues\\n\\n### 1.1 Inherent Phase Noise\\nOne of the primary limitations of Kerr frequency combs is their susceptibility to strong phase noise [3]. This noise arises from the nonlinear processes involved in comb generation and can degrade the quality of high-speed data transmission. The phase noise affects the stability of the comb lines, making it challenging to maintain the coherence required for long-distance transmission without significant signal degradation.', 'docs': ['We have studied O-band DwDM analog coherent systems that use either discrete lasers or DR-EO frequency comb generators as Tx and LO light sources, evaluating the achieveable transmission distance in the presence of fiber Kerr nonlinearity, losses, noise and timing skew. The results indicate that O-band analog coherent systems are susceptible to degradation from fiber Kerr nonlinear effects.  \\nCompared to systems using discrete lasers, comb-based systems are subject to about a 2-dB degradation of SNR because of losses from comb de-interleaving, flattening and demultiplexing, as well as noise from booster amplification. Nevertheless, when link losses are managed carefully, comb-based systems can support transmission distances required by all intra-data center links and some inter-data center links, even with high-order modulation formats. For instance, 17-channel 16-QAM and 8-PSK comb systems can transmit over $10\\\\mathrm{km}$ of fiber while maintaining a BER of $2.4\\\\times10^{-4}$ on all channels when additional link loss is kept below $2\\\\mathrm{dB}$ and $7\\\\mathrm{dB}$ , respectively. QPSK comb systems can support transmission distances exceeding $20\\\\mathrm{km}$ with over $10~\\\\mathrm{dB}$ of loss margin.  \\nWe found that linear and nonlinear crosstalk causes the performance of both discrete-laser and comb-based systems to depend on timing skew between channels. For 16-QAM and 8-PSK systems, the peak-to-peak normalized skew $\\\\epsilon$ should not exceed 0.1 and 0.2, respectively, in order to avoid reduction in achievable transmission distance. QPSK systems, however, are insensitive to timing skew impairments.  \\nWe have presented results for systems operating at a symbol rate of 56 Gbaud. Realizing systems using higher symbol rates, such as 100 Gbaud, requires careful design. Systems with higher symbol rates support lower achievable transmission distances and need wider channel spacing to avoid crosstalk.  \\nAPPENDIX A TIME SCALES OF LASER PHASE NOISE AND FIBER DISPERSION  \\nIn this section, we show that the coherence time of laser phase noise is much longer than the memory length of fiber chromatic dispersion. Hence, laser phase noise on the transmitted signal can be modeled as a constant phase offset when studying the effect of fiber propagation on system performance.  \\nWe define the coherence time of laser phase noise, $\\\\tau_{p n}$ , as  \\n$$\\n\\\\tau_{p n}=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\Delta\\\\nu},\\n$$', 'We experimentally investigate the dependence of Kerr comb generation, comb linewidth, and coherent system performance on the pump linewidth in a microresonator. We find that the generation of the primary comb can have a larger tolerance to the pump linewidth compared with that of the low-phase-noise comb. In addition, the linewidths of the generated combs are almost linearly dependent on the pump linewidth in the primary and low-phase-noise states. Furthermore, the optical signal-to-noise ratio penalty between the pump and generated Kerr combs in a coherent communication system is less than 0.2 dB in both the primary and low-phase-noise states, showing that Kerr frequency combs in these two states can have similar coherent system performance to the pump.  \\nThe optical frequency comb is of significant interest for a wide range of potential applications including time and frequency metrology, radio frequency (RF) signal generation, and optical communications [1-8]. Recently, a noticeable development in frequency comb technology is the use of integrated microring resonators to produce combs based on Kerr nonlinearity, enabling small footprints and broadband operations [9,10].  \\nThe approach to generating the chip-scale Kerr frequency combs is realized by cascaded four-wave-mixing (FWM) via coupling a continuous-wave (CW) pump into a high-quality (Q) microresonator. Depending on the pump power and wavelength, the formation of Kerr combs consists of several dynamic regimes, including Turing patterns (primary combs with a comb spacing of a multiple of the resonator free spectral range [FSR]), chaos, low-phase-noise (non-soliton) combs, and soliton combs [11-16]. These comb states could exhibit different degrees of coherence between comb lines leading to distinct noise properties [17-19]. Moreover, since the comb lines are derived from the pump, the pump phase noise could also affect the noise performance of different comb states, which might limit their applications such as being used as coherent light sources in optical communication systems [8,20,21].', 'There are several operating regimes of Kerr combs with different noise properties, including primary combs, chaotic combs, and stable soliton combs [16-18]. Primary combs with low noise are initiated by modulation instability of the pump [19]. Chaotic combs are characteristically very noisy due to multiple comb lines oscillating within one resonance [20]. Stable soliton combs with low noise result from the balance between Kerr nonlinearity and anomalous group velocity in the resonant [9-14]. Of interest are low-phase-noise Kerr combs, which have been experimentally demonstrated in multiple microresonator platforms [8-14]. They may present a possible alternative to individual lasers and a potential source for coherent wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission due to the high coherence of the frequency comb. Specifically, a total data capacity of 1.44 Tbit/s using lowphase-noise combs has been demonstrated in coherent communications [2]. A 20 Tbit/s WDM transmission covering the full C and L bands has also been demonstrated based on soliton combs [12]. Optical wavelength multicasting is a potentially important networking function, which copies the same data onto many different output signals for efficient data distribution and parallel processing [21-27]. It appears that microresonator-based Kerr combs could also be a potential tool for wavelength multicasting. However, it remains unclear how Kerr combs with different noise properties affect optical multicasting.  \\nIn this Letter, we describe the experimental investigation of the effect of Kerr combs with different noise properties on the multicasting performance. First, based on the low-phase-noise combs, we demonstrate seven-fold multicasting of a 20 Gbaud quadrature phase-shift-keyed (QPSK) signal to 71.7 GHz spaced copies. Seven generated comb lines are used as sources and input into a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. A constellation diagram with error vector magnitude (EVM) of $16\\\\%$ is achieved when the multicast copies are demodulated. The effect of high noise chaotic combs on the multicasting performance is also studied. It is observed that although wavelength conversion is taking place in the PPLN waveguide for the high-noise comb, the constellation diagrams of the multicast copies are dominated by high-intensity noise.', 'We demonstrate seamless channel multiplexing and high bitrate superchannel transmission of coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) data signals utilizing a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) frequency comb generated in an on-chip microcavity. Aided by comb line multiplication through Nyquist pulse modulation, the high stability and mutual coherence among mode-locked Kerr comb lines are exploited for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, to eliminate the guard intervals between communication channels and achieve full spectral density bandwidth utilization. Spectral efficiency as high as $2.625~\\\\mathrm{bit}/\\\\mathrm{Hz}/s$ is obtained for 180 CO-OFDM bands encoded with 12.75 Gbaud 8-QAM data, adding to the total bitrate of $6.885~\\\\mathrm{Tb}/s$ within a $2.295~\\\\mathrm{THz}$ frequency comb bandwidth. This Letter confirms that high coherence is the key superiority of Kerr soliton frequency combs over independent laser diodes, as a multi-spectral coherent laser source for high-bandwidth high-spectral-density transmission networks.  \\nKerr frequency combs produced in high-quality factor nonlinear microcavities present a new and promising platform for versatile multi-tone multi-color light carriers for frequency synthesis [1-3], precision metrology [4], laser spectroscopy [5], time keeping [6], microwave and terahertz signal generation [7,8], and optical communications [9-11]. These functionalities of the Kerr frequency comb furthermore can be achieved in a compact chip-scale footprint, with a simultaneous broadband spectrum, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high precision and stability, and low phase noise at the thermodynamical limits. In particular, such integratable frequency combs constitute an intrinsic multi-channel laser source for terabit op tical transmission networks [911]. Various types of Kerr combs, including a phase-locked microcomb associated with a stable Turing pattern [10] and mode-locked combs associated with bright dissipative Kerr soliton (DKs) [11], as well as dark solitons, have recently been leveraged to implement ultrahighcapacity optical transmissions, with a record bitrate in excess of $50\\\\mathrm{Tb}/s$ recently achieved by two interleaved DKS combs covering the entire optical communication $C_{-}$ and L-bands [11].', 'An exponential increase in network traffic urgently demands the optimized utilization of communication resources to efficiently utilize the optical spectrum for efficient and errorfree data transmission [24]. A single carrier transmitter system can increase the data transmission rate by increasing the bit rate without compromising the bandwidth requirement using a higher-order modulation format [25]. Furthermore, the data transmission rate can be doubled by polarization multiplexing [26]. The above-mentioned data transmission technique increases the spectral efficiency but at the cost of low data transmission distance. The transmission length can be increased by adding the error correction bits, but this will reduce the spectral efficiency by reducing the information rate [27]. The multicarrier data transmission is another most suitable spectral efficient data transmission technique [26, 28, 29]. To realize such optical transport networks, multiple equally spaced lower speed subcarriers can be multiplexed to transmit data over a single optical fiber, shown in figure 1(a) [11-21]. By doing so, the super-channel (combining several low-speed carriers into a single entity) can achieve a data transmission rate up to Tb/s. Electrical carrier multiplicity can also control the data transmission rate and occupy the bandwidth on a finer scale. However, a subcarrier generator is required for such a network transport system, which provides the evenly spaced multiple optical carriers (frequency lines). This block is solely responsible for providing the carrier signals to the transmitter system for the modulation process. The features required in such subcarrier generators are as follows:  \\ni. Standard laser features: The output carriers from the subcarrier generator should have standard output optical power (sufficient to transmit signal over a long distance), a high tone-to-noise ratio, and low phase noise (random change in the phase of a continuous wave signal) [24].']}, {'answer': \"### 1.2 Frequency Stability\\nWhile Kerr combs offer intrinsically stable frequency spacing, maintaining this stability over extended periods and varying environmental conditions remains a challenge [4]. Thermal fluctuations and mechanical stress can lead to variations in the comb's line spacing and central frequency, necessitating advanced stabilization techniques to ensure consistent performance in WDM systems.\", 'docs': ['Optical communications. Replacing a large number of lasers in wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) optical communication systems with an optical frequency comb has been an attractive idea for some time [51]. Optical frequency combs have an intrinsically stable frequency spacing that enables transmission-performance enhancements beyond what is possible with free-running lasers. Moreover, by using a frequency comb in WDM systems one can relax the resource requirements at the receiver by implementing joint impairment compensation and tracking for multiple data channels by exploiting the broadband phase coherence of the frequency comb. Micro-combs (or Kerr combs) use the Kerr effect in an integrated microcavity to convert light from a continuous-wave pump laser to evenly spaced lines across a wide bandwidth [31,34]. The performance of micro-combs is sufficiently high to cope with the requirements in terms of frequency stability, signal-to-noise ratio and linewidth of modern coherent communication systems [52-55]. Stabilized Kerr CSs in microresonators guarantee control of the bandwidth and number of comb lines with great precision [56]. By using two SiN micro-combs, thermal control and tuning of the central frequency has allowed the use of a matched comb at the receiver as a multi-wavelength local oscillator [56]. The line spacing can reach values in the order of $100\\\\mathrm{GHz},$ making micro-combs an attractive multi-wavelength light source for applications in fibre-optic communications. Micro-combs based on dark CSs [57] are particularly interesting for advanced coherent communications since they can display lower time jitter, e.g. $13{\\\\mathrm{~dB}}$ lower [58], than bright CSs. For example, a coherent transmission line using 64-quadrature amplitude modulation encoded onto the frequency lines of a dark CS comb has enabled transmitted optical signal-to-noise ratios above 33 dB in an $80~\\\\mathrm{km}$ data transmission with 20 channels [59].  \\nOptical clocks, frequency standards, GPs. Optical frequency combs have revolutionized metrology and advanced other fields such as RF photonics and astronomy. As mentioned above, traditional frequency combs can be bulky, expensive, and difficult to manufacture, thus limiting their use in real-world scenarios. Within the last decade or so, CS-based micro-combs have led to hopes of overcoming the constraints of more traditional bulk combs.', \"Kerr frequency comb produced in nonlinear microcavity presents a promising technology to provide versatile multicolor laser carers for optical communication networks. Various types of Kerr combs have been leveraged for ultrahigh capacity optical transmissions, with a record bitrate of $50~\\\\mathrm{Tb/s}$ achieved by two interleaved dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) microcombs [1]. However, one of the advantageous traits of Kerr microcomb as multichannel laser carriers, i.e., the high mutual coherence (spacing stability) among all comb lines, is yet to be exploited in data transmission scenario. The challenge mainly lies on two difficulties. First, to generate Kerr frequency comb with the mode spacing compatible with the state-of-art electrical data transceiver bandwidth (e.g. $10{\\\\sim}40~\\\\mathrm{GHz},$ , it requires relatively large circumference microcavities, thus increasing fabrication complexity. Second, due to the intrinsically low power conversion efficiency from the pump laser to Kerr comb lines, small comb spacing inevitably results in reduced comb power per-line, making it tougher for subsequent advanced-format data modulation, which requires the laser carriers to have as high as possible input power and optical-signal-to-noise-ratio (OSNR). Previously efforts to reduce Kerr comb spacing include interleaving two DKS combs [1], or inserting comb lines via electrooptical (EO) modulation [2]. But prior demonstrations haven't completely close up the intervals between channels, and whether the mutual coherence of Kerr comb can support seamless channel stitching remains an open question.  \\nHere we demonstrate unprecedentedly dense spectra bundling of CO-OFDM signals using a DKS microcomb. Through Nyquist modulation and delicately deployed optical amplification, we reduce the Kerr comb spacing from 191.31 GHz to $12.75~\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ while still maintaining high OsRN of individual comb line and low inter-line power fluctuation. 180 comb lines are generated and used to carry 12.75 Gbaud/s 8-QAM CO-OFDM signals, supporting a total bitrate up to. $6.885\\\\:\\\\mathrm{Tb/s}$\", \"Microcombs present an interesting challenge for frequency stabilization, as first pointed out in Ref. [24]. Specifically, the center frequency of a microcomb spectrum is matched to the pump laser, and the line spacing must be controlled by changing the resonator's physical properties. Future metrology applications of microcombs will require stabilization of the line spacing with respect to fixed-optical and microwave frequency standards. Hence, the key factors for stabilization are a line spacing in the measurable $10\\\\mathrm{^{\\\\circ}s}$ of GHz range (Ref. [28] describes a technique at ${\\\\tt>}100~\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ , low intrinsic fluctuations, and the capability for fast modulation. Additionally, a threshold power for comb generation in the milliwatt range and the potential for integration with chip-based photonic circuits would enable portable applications.  \\nHere, we report a new microcomb platform for achieving these goals. We have developed a $\\\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ -laser-machining technique that yields microrod optical resonators with a $Q\\\\gtrsim5\\\\times10^{8}$ , a user-defined diameter, and a small effective mode area. The optical modes of these cavities can be rapidly controlled by using mechanical forces that alter the resonator's shape [29,30]. With such microrods, we create a comb spectrum with 32.6-GHz-spaced lines spanning from $1510\\\\mathrm{nm}$ to $1620\\\\mathrm{nm}$ Our work introduces wideband mechanical control of the microcomb line spacing and its stabilization with respect to microwave standards. Mechanical control offers significant advantages, including low-power operation, simple integration with bulk resonators, and response potentially much faster than resonator thermal conduction [31]. We have improved the residual line-spacing fluctuations by more than a factor of 200 beyond previous microcomb work [24]. And we demonstrate the potential of microcombs to support optical frequency references that feature stability in the $\\\\bar{1}0^{-15}$ range.\", 'We report on the stabilization of a microresonator-based optical frequency comb (microcomb) by way of mechanical actuation. These experiments use novel $\\\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ -laser-machined microrod resonators, which are introduced here and feature optical $Q\\\\gtrsim5\\\\times10^{8}$ , less than 1 minute processing time, and tunable geometry. Residual fluctuations of our $32.6~\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ microcomb line spacing reach a stability level of $5\\\\times10^{-15}$ for 1 s averaging, thereby highlighting the potential of microcombs to support modern opticalfrequency standards. Furthermore, measurements of the line spacing with respect to an independent frequency reference reveal stabilization of different spectral slices of the comb with a ${<}0.5\\\\mathrm{-}\\\\mathrm{mHz}$ variation among 140 comb lines spanning $4.5~\\\\mathrm{THz}$ . Together, these results demonstrate an important step in the development of microcombs, namely, that they can be fabricated and precisely controlled with simple and accessible techniques.  \\nControl and stabilization of optical frequency combs enables a range of scientific and technological applications, including frequency metrology at high precision [1-3], spectroscopy of quantum gases [4] and of molecules from visible wavelengths to the far infrared [5], searches for exoplanets [6,7], and photonic waveform synthesis [8,9]. Recently, a new class of frequency combs based on monolithic microresonators has emerged, which offer significantly reduced bulk, cost, and complexity beyond what is possible with conventional femtosecond-laser technology [10]. Such factors stand in the way of nextgeneration applications that will require high-performance optical clocks for experiments outside the lab.  \\nIn microcomb systems, the comb generation relies on parametric conversion provided by third-order nonlinear optical effects and is enabled by high-quality factors $\\\\boldsymbol{Q}$ and small mode volumes of microresonators. To date, microcombs have been explored with a number of microresonator technologies, including microtoroids [11], crystalline resonators [12-14], microrings [15,16], fiber cavities [17], machined disks [18], and disk resonators [19]. Unique comb spectra have been demonstrated, featuring octave spans [20,21] and a wide range of line spacings [22]. And some aspects of the microcomb frequency-domain behavior have been explained [12,18,23-27].', 'Although not discussed thus far, one limitation of ultra-high- $Q$ cavities is their intrinsic sensitivity to environmental changes, in particular thermal effects. This challenge was originally highlighted in the initial papers on frequency comb generation in the 1980s and was reiterated in the Nobel Prize lectures given in 2005.  \\nBecause the resonant wavelength is determined by both the refractive index and the device diameter, a subtle change in the index will shift the resonant wavelength. This  \\nshift will result in changes in the comb, both the center frequency and the relative intensity of the lines. Therefore, while the line spacing is constant (because different frequencies are thermally shifted by almost the same values), other parameters will vary with environmental changes. And, if the changes are very large, the cavity can shift off-resonance, resulting in the loss of comb generation. Given that most comb applications are related to using the comb as a reference, this source of instability is not desirable. Therefore, significant efforts have been invested in developing methods to reduce the effects of thermal and electrical noise.  \\nInitially, most methods were based on passive mutual locking of the resonator pumped mode and the laser using a thermal lock by leveraging the thermo-optic effect intrinsic to the cavity or based on actively utilizing a feedback loop in the system. As broader combs spanning over an octave were developed, more advanced locking methods based on self-locking could be applied. These systems used the cavity itself as the fedback loop and allowed the demonstration of locked soliton combs that had long-term stability, offering the first glimpse of possible applications. More recently, to achieve even higher stability along with precision and accuracy, researchers are locking combs with each other. By using one broad (large FSR) and one narrow (small FSR) comb, the combs are extremely stable and calibrated with high precision.']}, {'answer': '## 2. Scalability Concerns\\n\\n### 2.1 Receiver Scalability\\nAlthough Kerr combs address scalability issues at the transmitter side by providing multiple equidistant carriers, the scalability problem at the receiver largely remains unsolved [1]. Most experiments still rely on external cavity lasers (ECLs) as optical local oscillators (LOs) for coherent reception, which limits the overall system scalability. Developing a fully integrated multi-wavelength LO solution based on Kerr combs is essential for achieving scalable WDM systems.', 'docs': ['The present capacity increase of optical networks relies mainly on wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and coherent transmission. The associated transceiver systems need to be cost-efficient and compact while featuring low power consumption. These requirements can be partially fulfilled by high-density integration of IQ modulators and coherent receivers, e.g., on the silicon photonic platform1. Scalability of the associated optical sources, however, is still an issue, notably for transmission of tens of Tbit/s, where hundreds of individually stabilized lasers are usually used?. At the transmitter, these limitations may be overcome by frequency comb sources3, in particular when realized as chip-scale devices4. Carriers derived from such comb sources are equidistant in frequency so that guard bands between WDM channels can be minimized. Moreover, the strong correlation of the carrier frequency fluctuations enables efficient compensation of nonlinear fiber impairments5. We have recently demonstrated that Kerr soliton frequency combs represent a particularly attractive option6, enabling transmission of a total data stream of 50.2 Tbit/s on 176 carriers over a distance of $75~{\\\\mathsf{k m}}$ . Still, with a few exceptions at comparatively low data rates?, all these experiments rely on external cavity lasers (ECL) as optical local oscillators (LO) for coherent reception, leaving the scalability problem at the receiver Iargely unsolved.  \\nIn this work we report on the first massively parallel WDM transmission experiment using a frequency comb as a multi-wavelength LO for coherent reception. We use a pair of silicon nitride (Si3N4) Kerr soliton comb sources8,9 with nearly identical line spacing to provide both the WDM carriers and the LO tones. Using 99 WDM channels in the C and L bands, we transmit an aggregate data stream of 34.6 Tbit/s over $75~{\\\\mathsf{k m}}$ of standard single-mode fiber (SsMF). We further show that the performance achieved with the soliton Kerr frequency comb as multi-wavelength LO compares well to the one achieved with a tuneable high-quality ECL LO.', 'For application in optical communications, frequency comb sources must be compact. In recent years, various chip-scale comb sources have been demonstrated14-16 that enable transmission of WDM data streams with line rates16 of up to 12 Tbit $\\\\ensuremath{\\\\boldsymbol{s}}^{-1}$ . However, transmission at higher line rates requires more carriers and lower noise levels, and still relies on spectral broadening of narrowband seed combs using dedicated optical fibres,11,12 or nanophotonic waveguides1?. In addition, generating uniform combs with a broadband spectral envelope often requires delicate dispersion management schemes, usually in combination with intermediate amplifiersl1. Such schemes are difficult to miniaturize and are not readily amenable to chip-scale integration. Moreover, with a few exceptions at comparatively low data rates18, all advanced combbased transmission experiments exploit the scalability advantages only at the transmitter, not at the receiver, where individual continuous-wave lasers are still used as optical local oscillators for coherent detection.  \\nHere we show that $\\\\mathrm{DKS}s^{3}$ generated in integrated photonic microresonators6 via Kerr-nonlinear four-photon interactions, provide highly stable broadband frequency combs that can overcome the scalability limitations of massively parallel optical transmission at both the transmitter and the receiver. Microresonator-based Kerr comb sources19,20 have advantages such as a small footprint (the physical area covered by the comb source), a large number of narrowlinewidth optical carriers, and line spacings of tens of gigahertz, which can be designed to fit established WDM frequency grids. However, although these advantages have been recognized, previous transmission experiments21 were limited to aggregate line rates of 1.44 Tbit $\\\\ensuremath{\\\\mathbf{s}}^{-1}$ owing to strong irregularities of the optical spectrum associated with the specific Kerr comb states.', \"Solitons are waveforms that preserve their shape while propagating, as a result of a balance of dispersion and nonlinearityl,2. Solitonbased data transmission schemes were investigated in the 1980s and showed promise as a way of overcoming the limitations imposed by dispersion of optical fibres. However, these approaches were later abandoned in favour of wavelength-division multiplexing schemes, which are easier to implement and offer improved scalability to higher data rates. Here we show that solitons could make a comeback in optical communications, not as a competitor but as a key element of massively parallel wavelength-division multiplexing. Instead of encoding data on the soliton pulse train itself, we use continuous-wave tones of the associated frequency comb as carriers for communication. Dissipative Kerr solitons $(\\\\mathbf{D}\\\\mathbf{KSs})^{3,4}$ (solitons that rely on a double balance of parametric gain and cavity loss, as well as dispersion and nonlinearity) are generated as continuously circulating pulses in an integrated silicon nitride microresonator' via four-photon interactions mediated by the Kerr nonlinearity, leading to low-noise, spectrally smooth, broadband optical frequency combs. We use two interleaved DKS frequency combs to transmit a data stream of more than 50 terabits per second on 179 individual optical carriers that span the entire telecommunication C and L bands (centred around infrared telecommunication wavelengths of 1.55 micrometres). We also demonstrate coherent detection of a wavelength-division multiplexing data stream by using a pair of DKS frequency combs--one as a multi-wavelength light source at the transmitter and the other as the corresponding local oscillator at the receiver. This approach exploits the scalability of microresonator-based DKS frequency comb sources for massively parallel optical communications at both the transmitter and the receiver. Our results demonstrate the potential of these sources to replace the arrays of continuous-wave lasers that are currently used in highspeed communications. In combination with advanced spatial multiplexing schemes7, and highly integrated silicon photonic circuits', DKS frequency combs could bring chip-scale petabitper-second transceivers into reach.\", 'In this context, optical frequency comb generators (FCGs) may play a key role as compact and robust multi-wavelength light sources that can provide large numbers of well-defined optical carriers. A particularly important advantage of frequency combs is the fact that comb lines are inherently equidistant in frequency, hence relaxing the requirements for interchannel guard bands [4] and avoiding frequency control of individual lines as needed in conventional schemes that combine arrays of independent distributed feedback (DFB) lasers. Note that these advantages do not apply only to the WDM transmitter but also to the receiver, where an array of discrete local oscillators (LO) may be replaced by a single comb generator [5--7]. Using an LO comb further facilitates joint digital signal processing of the WDM channels, which may reduce receiver complexity and increase phase noise tolerance [8]. Moreover, parallel coherent reception using an LO comb with phase-locked tones might even allow the reconstruction the time-domain waveform of the overall wDM signal and thus permit compensation of impairments caused by optical nonlinearities of the transmission fiber [9].  \\nBesides these conceptual advantages of comb-based transmission, compact footprint and cost-efficient mass production are key for future WDM transceivers. Among the various comb generator concepts, chip-scale devices are therefore of particular interest [6,7,10-20]. When combined with highly scalable photonic integrated circuits for modulation, multiplexing, routing, and reception of data signals, such devices may become the key to compact and energy-efficient WDM transceivers that can be fabricated in large quantities at low cost and that can offer transmission capacities of tens of Tbit/s per fiber.', 'generation WDM systems because of its mutual coherence that is much higher than individual lasers [4-5]. Thanks to the outstanding mutual coherence performance, the locked frequency and phase between transmitter comb (data carriers) and receiver comb (LOs) can be fulfilled with a tolerable loss of spectral efficiency.  \\nWDM optical communications based on optical frequency comb can enable remarkable transmission performance enhancements than using individual lasers and has been widely demonstrated in various of platforms, such as modelocked laser comb [6], electro-optical (EO) frequency comb [7], semiconductor gain-switched laser comb [8], and Kerr soliton comb [9]. However, to date, the key issue of achieving frequency and phase locking between the transmitter comb and the receiver comb has not been comprehensively studied. According to pioneering researches, EO frequency comb can achieve mutual locking via sending pilot tones (PT) from the transmitter to receiver. But, the cavity-less nature of EO combs requires extremely fast and strong RF driving to assign the comb spacing to a broadband comb spectrum, leading to unfavorable system volume, complexity, and energy cost. Kerr comb generated in integrated microcavity platform, that naturally links frequency and phase coherence to pump laser, can provide an ideal PT-based comb locking scheme to achieve mutually locked combs for transmitters and receivers.  \\nIn this paper, we propose and demonstrate high fidelity Kerr soliton regeneration (we call such process as Kerr comb cloning) over metropolitan distance at receiver side via using the techniques of pump laser conveying and twopoint locking. The cloned combs with outstanding frequency and phase coherence serve as transmitter carrier and receiver LO comb sources for high-capacity coherent communication and achieve substantial DSP complexity saving for frequency and phase compensation.']}, {'answer': '### 2.2 Channel Count Limitations\\nThe number of channels that can be effectively managed with Kerr combs is constrained by the available bandwidth and the precision with which the comb lines can be controlled [5]. While Kerr combs can cover multiple telecommunication bands with typical line spacings between 10 GHz and 100 GHz, increasing the channel count beyond a certain point may lead to overlapping or insufficient guard bands, thus reducing spectral efficiency.', 'docs': [\"Optical carriers for WDM transmission are commonly generated by distributed feedback (DFB) laser arrays. Chip-scale transmitter systems with DFB lasers have been realized on InP substrates, showing potential for simultaneous operation of 40 channels15. However, these approaches cannot be transferred directly to the silicon photonic platform, as combining conventional DFB laser arrays with silicon photonic transmitters would require a multitude of chip-chip interfaces, thereby significantly increasing the packaging effort. Hybrid integration of -v dies on silicon substratesl6 avoids these interfaces, but scalability to large channel counts is still limited by the gain bandwidth of the semiconductor material and by thermal constraints. Moreover, the spectral efficiency of DFB-based transmission systems suffers from the uncertainty of the individual emission frequencies, which is of the order of several gigahertz and requires appropriate guard bands to avoid spectral overlap of neighbouring WDM channels. For dense WDM with a channel spacing of, for example, $25\\\\mathrm{GHz},$ the guard bands consume a significant fraction of the available transmission bandwidth.  \\nThese limitations can be overcome by exploiting optical frequency combs as sources for wDM transmission. Frequency. combs consist of a multitude of equidistant spectral lines, each of which can be modulated individually1,17,1. The inherently constant frequency spacing of the comb lines enables the transmission of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals' or of Nyquist-wDM signals1s with 'closely spaced subcarriers. Frequency combs with line spacings in the gigahertz range can be generated by external modulation of a narrowband continuouswave (c.w.) signal19, by mode-locked lasers based on semiconductor quantum-dot or quantum-dash materials2o, or by exploiting parametric frequency conversion in Kerr-nonlinear high-Q microcavities. In contrast to modulator-based approaches or mode-locked laser diodes, the bandwidth of Kerr combs is neither limited by the achievable modulation depth nor by the gain bandwidth of the active medium. Kerr combs can therefore exhibit bandwidths of hundreds of nanometres21, thereby covering multiple telecommunication bands (such as the $\\\\mathrm{C},\\\\mathrm{L}$ and U bands) with typical line spacings between $10\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ and $100\\\\mathrm{GHz}$\", \"The world's optical- fibre communications network forms the backbone of the global internet and now supports hundreds of terabits of data every second, with demand growing exponentially at  $- 25\\\\%$  per annum. The success of optical data communications is a result of the extremely wide optical bandwidth available in optical fibre, and when combined with erbium- doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs), this enables systems with enormous data bandwidths that are able to transmit, modulate, amplify and switch at rates not achievable with other technologies. Commercial long- haul systems now operate from 1,530 to 1,610 nm (the telecom C and L bands), representing over 10 THz of optical frequency bandwidth in the near- infrared, and new technologies are continually expanding this. With the latest electronic chip interface speeds limited to  $- 100\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ , to fully exploit the available optical bandwidths, the spectrum must be sliced into multiple independent channels. This technology (termed wavelength division multiplexing, WDM) underpinned the rapid expansion of the global internet in the 1990s, and it has evolved to extremely sophisticated ultrahigh- capacity transmission links that employ massively parallel WDM systems using highly advanced coherent modulation formats. These systems typically use independent discrete laser sources for each channel carrier, with data modulated onto these carriers using external modulators. In this way, each individual channel can interface directly with state- of- the- art electronic interfaces, making the entire ultrahigh- bandwidth optical communications spectrum available for digital communication technologies. In this approach, spectral gaps- or guard- bands'- must be left to allow for laser frequency drift and thus avoid interference between neighbouring wavelength channels, and this reduces the spectral efficiency. The continually increasing requirement for higher data rates in fibre- optic communications systems have placed extreme demands on optical components and subsystems, particularly transmitters and receivers.  \\nOptical frequency combs (OFCs) have emerged as attractive sources for communications for a number of reasons, including reducing or eliminating the need for guard- bands, thus freeing up much more of the optical spectrum to be used for data transmission.\", 'The choice of the center frequency depends essentially on the link length and on the data rate. If chromatic dispersion of standard SMF is an issue, light sources operating close to the zero-dispersion wavelength $1.3\\\\upmu\\\\mathrm{m}$ are desirable. However, if minimum fiber attenuation and the availability of widely used telecommunication devices like erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are important, a center wavelength near $1.55\\\\upmu\\\\mathrm{m}$ is preferable.  \\nThe frequency spacing of the comb lines should be tens of gigahertz and adhere to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard for WDM transmission specifying line spacings of 12.5, 25, 50, or $100\\\\:\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ and integer multiples thereof. For isolated point-to-point links, for example, in proprietary data center networks, the line spacing could also deviate from the ITU standards. In general, comb generators with tunable line spacing provide highest flexibility.  \\nFinally, the number of lines is a crucial parameter, dictating the number of WDM channels that can be transmitted or detected in parallel. Note that there is no generally accepted metric for quantifying the line count of a frequency comb-publications may refer to the number of lines within the 3-dB bandwidth [23,24] or the 10-dB bandwidth [25] of the comb or to the number of lines that were usable for data transmission [4,16]. As the total comb power is generally limited, the individual lines will have lower power as the number of lines increases. For large line counts, optical amplifiers are needed to boost the optical power prior to modulation, and this will have direct impact on the achievable optical signal-to-noise power ratio (OSNR) of the WDM transmitter, see Section 2.2.3. If the comb is amplified as a whole, the optical amplifier bandwidth may additionally limit the number of usable tones.', '$$  \\nThe transmitter contains a series of amplifiers (Gpre/sdm/mod/link) that counteract losses at each stage at the cost of additional noise. The factor V accounts for polarization filtering and modulator-induced spectral broadening. Further details and mathematical derivations are presented in the Methods.  \\nNote that the SNR depends on the channel bandwidth (which is equal to $R_{s}^{\\\\mathrm{~\\\\}}$ ) and the number of SDM channels through the SDM noise term $(N_{\\\\mathrm{SDM}})$ as the comb lines are power-divided into $m_{\\\\tt S D M}$ channels and subsequently amplified, adding noise. The number of WDM channels is generally set by the bandwidth of the comb source and the equip. ment, whereas the number of possible SDM channels directly relates to how many times the power can be split and amplified before the OSNR is too low to allow data transmission. For telecommunication purposes, we will limit ourselves to a $10\\\\mathsf{T H z}$ bandwidth covering the C- and lower L-bands $(1,530\\\\mathrm{-}1,610\\\\mathrm{nm})$ , and compare comb sources of different initial values of ${\\\\bf\\\\ddot{\\\\boldsymbol P}}_{0}$  \\nBy contrast to ref. 35, we focus on calculating the total capacity as a function of the number of SDM channels for a variety of different sources. This is shown in Fig. 2, in which we used realistic parameters to calculate the SNR (see Methods). The frequency-comb sources are assumed to have full spectral efficiency whereas the multiple laser sources are modelled with an additional spectral guard band of 5 GHz between the lines to compensate for realistic laser frequency drifts37. Although full spectral efficiency is difficult to achieve in practice due to non-idealities in the transmitter, the necessary guard band can be substantially reduced below 5 GHz.', 'The different comb sources have line powers varying from -30 dBm to -10 dBm, based on performances from various published experiments14,32,38. Although the laser sources have a higher intrinsic SNR and $P_{0}$ and can therefore forego many of the noise-adding amplifiers, the comb-based sources all have a higher spectral efficiency due to the buffer region omission. Figure 2a clearly shows that a frequency comb-based source is a competitive option for fibre-based communication compared with an array of lasers, even with the considerably lower power available. For short transmission distances and fewer than 100 SDM channels, combs with a power per line as low as $-20$ dBm already show comparable performances with laser-array and one-laser-per-channel systems. At a lower number ofSDM channels, the frequency combs outperform the laser array due to the higher spectral efficiency. From 200 sDM channels onwards, the onelaser-per-channel case outperforms the comb sources due to the much larger SNR, but at the cost of being more hardware intensive (Fig. 2b). Here we see that the number of Iasers needed in comb and one-laser-per-channel systems differs by several orders of magnitude, but only by a factor of two in the number of amplifiers. This advantage will decrease as the number of SDM channels grow and the number of modulators become the overwhelming majority of the required components.  \\nIt is observed that petabit-per-second-class systems can be achieved for this ideal system when the number of SDM channels is above 15, and the green star in Fig. 2a indicates our achievement of 1.84 Pbit $\\\\mathsf{\\\\pmb{s}}^{-1}$ using 37 SDM channels (see below). We also find that 100 Pbit $\\\\mathsf{\\\\pmb{s}}^{-1}$ may be achieved for about 1,500 SDM channels using a comb source with a realistic -10 dBm line power. The laser array requires a $13\\\\%$ increase in SDM channel count to reach 100 Pbit $\\\\mathsf{s}^{-1}$ due to the lower spectral efficiency. Such high SDM channel counts may be achieved using bundled single-mode fibres or a few ultrahigh-count multicore fibres39.']}, {'answer': '## 3.

In addition, the intrinsic relative frequency stability of the frequency comb and the phase coherence between the comb lines can enable unique advantages over the individual lasers, such as increased spectral efficiency by reducing guard-bands or even achieving below zero guard-band, joint digital signal processing by sharing phase information, and mitigation of nonlinear impairments in the fibre link [18-20].

Nanofabrication powerfully enables nonlinear processes by enhancing intensity with small mode volume and by precise lithographic pattern transfer and heterogeneous combinations of materials that facilitate nonlinear phase-matching. These properties are also enabling for integrated (linear) photonics applications, including microwave photonics [8], high-speed optical communication [9] and heterogeneous electronic-photonic integration of lasers and other devices [10]. Therefore, ideal materials are versatile and robust, straightforwardly allowing heterogeneous integration.  \\nStoichiometric silicon nitride $(\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ hereafter SiN) obtained via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition is an exemplary material for Kerr-nonlinear photonics, offering exceptionally low optical loss [11], moderately strong Kerr nonlinear coefficient [12], and compatibility with CMOS semiconductor nanofabrication [12]. Still large, intrinsic tensile stress $({>}1\\\\ \\\\mathrm{GPa})$ is a particular challenge with SiN that leads to formation of cracks in the photonics layer [4]. Crackmitigation strategies require additional, specialized processing steps, including combinations of thermal cycling [13] and damascene growth [14]. Besides SiN, several other photonic-integration materials have been used for the benchmark application of Kerr-soliton generation, including silica with silicon-nitride waveguides[15], deuterated silicon nitride [16], soliton crystals in Hydex [17], aluminum nitride [18], (aluminum) gallium arsenide [19], lithium niobate [20], and gallium phosphide [21].', 'Integrated photonic circuits based on silicon nitride $(\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4})$ are extensively used for microresonator based optical frequency comb generation. $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ provides compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes and has a large bandgap covering a wide spectral transparency window [1], without suffering from nonlinear absorption, which is problematic in silicon photonic circuits [2,3]. In addition, $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ exhibits a relatively high Kerr nonlinearity compared to silica. Thus, many applications have been demonstrated with $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ based microresonators, including optical spectroscopy [4], biological imaging [5,6], and telecommunications [7,8]. Recent developments include heterogeneously integrated laser soliton microcombs on a monolithic silicon substrate via integrating semiconductor lasers with $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ microresonators [9]. Using III-V-on-silicon photonic integration, a chip-scale photonic system has been successfully used for optical data transmission and microwave photonics [10]. There has been growing interest in the integration of frequency combs for optical computing and optical neural networks, as well as for parallel convolutional and photonic convolutional accelerators [11].', 'Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are devices that manipulate light by confining it in a core material with a high refractive index, surrounded by a cladding material, typically silicon oxide $(\\\\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ , which displays a lower refractive index [1]. These devices are usually fabricated on a wafer in a planar process, where only one core material with a defined thickness is included. The core material and geometry play a key role in determining what functionalities can be integrated into a single PIC. The silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform has been extremely successful in PIC development because most basic optical operations can be implemented in this material, such as low-loss routing [2], modulation [1] and detection [3], and the manufacturing cost is low thanks to the direct compatibility with the CMOS processes. However, dedicated platforms generally outperform Si in specific operations, such as ultralow-loss routing [4] and near-infrared nonlinear optics in silicon nitride [5-7], detection in germanium [8], electro-optic modulation in lithium niobate [9], and light generation in, e.g., indium phosphide [10]. Therefore, when designing a PIC, the specific trade-offs of the platform of choice have to be considered. To overcome this limitation, numerous efforts have been made to integrate multiple materials and platforms on the same PIC. By combining multiple platforms, the PIC can achieve denser routing [11], better fiber-to-chip coupling [12], integration of light sources [13,14], or more efficient modulation [15].  \\nAmong the different material platforms, silicon nitride $(\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4})$ stands out for ultralow-loss PICs thanks to the broad transparency window, from visible to mid-infrared [16,17], and the compatibility with CMOS processes, which guarantees reliability and scalability. Moreover, $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ displays high Kerr nonlinearities and lacks two-photon absorption in the near-infrared, which makes it an excellent platform for nonlinear optics, e.g., microcomb generation [5,18-22], noiseless parametric amplification [23] and supercontinuum generation [24-28].', 'In this communication, authors report for the first time on the fabrication and testing of $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ non-linear photonic circuits for CMOS-compatible monolithic co-integration with silicon-based optoelectronics. In particular, a novel process has been developed to fabricate low-loss crack-free $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ 750-nm-thick films for Kerr-based nonlinear functions featuring full thermal budget compatibility with existing Silicon photonics and front-end Si optoelectronics. Briefly, differently from previous and state-of-the-art works, our nonlinear nitride-based platform has been realized without resorting to commonly-used high-temperature annealing $({\\\\sim}1200^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C})$ of the film and its silica uppercladding used to break N-H bonds otherwise causing absorption in the C-band and destroying its nonlinear functionality. Furthermore, no complex and fabrication-intolerant Damascene proces - as recently reported earlier this year - aimed at controlling cracks generated in thick tensile-strained $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ films has been used as well. Instead, a tailored $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ multiple-step film deposition in $200\\\\mathrm{-mm}$ LPCVD-based reactor and subsequent low-temperature $(400^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C})$ PECVD oxide encapsulation have been used to fabricate the nonlinear microresonant circuits aiming at generating optical frequency combs via optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), thus allowing the monolithic cointegration of such nonlinear functions on existing CMOS-compatible optoelectronics, for both active and passive components such as, for instance, silicon modulators and wavelength (de-)multiplexers.

Any deviations from ideal specifications can lead to increased insertion losses or reduced comb quality, impacting the overall system performance. Streamlining these fabrication processes while maintaining high quality is a critical challenge.', 'docs': ['Recent innovations, such as the photonic Damascene process, have enabled the fabrication of SiN waveguides with unprecedented smoothness and reduced scattering losses. $^{14,17}$  This process involves pre patterning the substrate before the deposition of SiN, followed by a reflow step that smooths the waveguide surfaces and reduces high spatial frequency roughness components. The resulting waveguides have achieved record- low propagation losses, with quality factors (Q- factors) exceeding  $10^{6}$ , making them suitable for high- performance nonlinear photonic applications such as Kerr frequency comb generation. $^{4,17}$  Moreover, dispersion engineering in SiN waveguides is critical for enabling broadband and coherent optical frequency combs, which have applications ranging from telecommunications to spectroscopy. By carefully tailoring the waveguide dimensions, it is possible to achieve anomalous group velocity dispersion (GVD), which is necessary for the formation of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in microresonators. $^{4}$  The combination of ultra- low loss and precise dispersion control in SiN waveguides is therefore essential for advancing the capabilities of integrated photonic systems.  \\nIn this paper, we report the fabrication and characterization of ultra- low loss, dispersion- engineered SiN waveguides on 300 nm wafers. Building upon the advancements in the photonic Damascene process, we achieve propagation losses below 0.2 dB/cm while maintaining tight mode confinement and engineered dispersion properties with a 700 nm thick waveguide layer. Our results represent a significant step forward in the development of  \\nSiN photonic platforms, with potential implications for a wide range of applications in nonlinear optics, quantum photonics, and spectroscopy.', 'The fabrication approach can vary significantly depending on the microresonator platform and materials used. Here, a brief review of the fabrication process for two currently widely used microresonator platforms is given.  \\nThe crystalline microresonators, such as $\\\\mathrm{MgF}_{2}$ $\\\\mathrm{CaF}_{2}$ , and ${\\\\mathrm{SrF}}_{2}$ , are typically fabricated from the crystalline preforms (rods), using a process that can be divided in two steps, as shown in Fig. 2.10. In the first step, the crystalline rod is shaped to have a small, axis-symmetric protrusion around its circumference. For this, the preform is fixed on the rotating spindle and diamond-turning machine is used to define the resonator protrusion. After this step, the roughness of the fabricated resonators can be rather high, and the second step, polishing, is needed. In the polishing step, the resonator is polished with diamond slurries in several stages using decreasing size of the diamond nanoparticles, down to tenth of nanometers. Thus, the resonator surface roughness can be brought below one nanometer rms, allowing the access to ultrahigh Q-factors above ${10}^{9}$ (up to $10^{11}$ ). Despite their low nonlinear refractive index and relatively large effective mode area, these microresonators can still have microwatt-level thresholds for hyperparametric oscillations resulting from exceptionally high-quality factors. Light can be evanescently coupled to such microresonators via coupling prism or tapered fiber.  \\nOn the other hand, the vast majority of on-chip microresonators, which are currently used for Kerr comb experiments, are produced using microfabrication techniques. The most advanced among these material platforms in terms of DKS generation is that of $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ was introduced as a waveguide platform for Kerr comb generation by Levy et al. [70] as a suitable alternative to Si, which exhibited two-photon and free-carrier absorption at telecom wavelengths [96]. As $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ has its bandgap located near the ultraviolet domain [97], it does not suffer from this problem, limiting the major sources of losses to impurities and waveguide roughness [98], and so is able to exhibit a high nonlinearity-to-loss ratio. There have been two major methods for the fabrication of low-loss $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ waveguides: subtractive and Damascene, the process flows depicted in Fig. 2.11A and B, respectively.', 'Of particular interest are OFCs based on the silicon nitride (SiN) platform. SiN is an ideal material due to its broadband transparency from the visible to mid- IR, large bandgap, and compatibility with complementary metal- oxide- semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes. $^{14}$  These properties allow for the development of integrated photonic devices with tight confinement of light, which is essential for achieving high nonlinearity and precise dispersion engineering. Recent advancements in the fabrication of high- Q SiN waveguides have enabled the realization of broadband frequency combs on chip- based platforms, showcasing their potential for highly compact and energy- efficient photonic devices. $^{15,16}$  Despite these advancements, achieving ultra- low propagation losses in SiN waveguides remains a challenging task. Propagation losses in integrated photonic devices are often orders of magnitude higher than those in standard optical fibers, primarily due to scattering from sidewall roughness and absorption from impurities in the material. $^{17}$  While traditional approaches have focused on reducing scattering losses through surface smoothing techniques and optimizing waveguide dimensions, absorption losses—particularly those associated with transition metal impurities have also been identified as a significant contributor to the overall loss budget. $^{17}$', 'We first illustrate the concept of a WDM communication system in which a microresonator frequency comb is exploited as a multi-wavelength light source [Fig. 1(a)]. A miniature microresonator converts a continuous-wave (c.w.) laser emission into equidistant comb lines, potentially replacing a massive laser diode array with only a single-frequency pump laser. Here, we adopt two microcomb platforms; one is silicon nitride $(\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4})$ microrings, and the other is magnesium fluoride $(\\\\mathrm{MgF}_{2})$ crystalline microresonators. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ and $\\\\mathrm{MgF}_{2}$ microresonators, respectively. Several differences, such as typical quality factors, mode volumes, and resonator sizes, determine the fundamental properties of microcombs.  \\nCrystalline microresonators generally exhibit an extremely high Q of up to $10^{9}$ , which allows us to obtain a narrow free-spectral range (FSR) microcomb reaching sub- $10\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ . In contrast, the usual FSR range with a $\\\\mathrm{Si}_{3}\\\\mathrm{N}_{4}$ microring corresponds to $100{\\\\mathrm{-}}1000\\\\ \\\\mathrm{GHz}$ .The resonator fabrication method also makes a significant difference in that silicon nitride microresonators made from CMOS-compatible material can be massively integrated into a single chip [32] Crystalline resonators are usually fabricated with diamond turning and subsequent polishing methods, which limit precise geometry control [33]; however, recent studies have shown the possibility of fully computer-controlled crystalline resonator fabrication that can overcome this drawback [34-36]. For crystalline microresonators, a tapered fiber coupler provides an extremely low insertion loss, otherwise a prism coupler is compatible with a system that is more robust as regards external perturbation. Moreover, dedicated effort has led to an improvement in the Q-factors and insertion losses of chip-integrated resonators, and recently low-repetition-rate microcomb have been reported [37,38].', 'This work shows that both the soft mask and hard mask procedures provide reliable means to fabricating on-chip microresonators with high quality. As the optical testing shows similar Q factors for both processes, we suspect that Qs are limited by other factors, such as etch-related sidewall roughness or LPCVD SiN quality. The soft mask process carries the advantage of fewer steps and simplicity but requires optimization of the patterned resist structure to ensure an accurate and clean transfer of the desired pattern to SiN. In addition, extending fabrication of microring resonators to materials that are more etch resistant than SiN (e.g. such as tantalum pentoxide) increases the desirability of etching using harder mask templates. The development of both processes presented here constitutes a useful toolbox to be applied to future studies of a wide range of devices while remaining compatible with CMOS fabrication for future photonic integration.']}, {'answer': '## 5. Power Consumption and Cost\\n\\n### 5.1 Energy Efficiency\\nWhile Kerr combs offer potential cost and space savings compared to banks of individual lasers, their energy efficiency must be carefully considered [2]. The pump laser power required for comb generation and the associated electronics for stabilization and control can contribute significantly to the overall power consumption of the system. Optimizing these aspects is necessary to achieve cost-effective and energy-efficient solutions.', 'docs': [\"Electro-optic modulation using Mach-Zehnder devices generates optical frequency combs (OFCs) by inducing periodic phase shifts in a continuous-wave laser. This process leads to the formation of evenly spaced spectral lines resulting from interference effects between two optical paths. However, a key limitation of this approach is its significant sensitivity to temperature variations and electrical instabilities, which can introduce unwanted distortions in the generated comb and consequently limit the system's stability and overall performance [7]. On the other hand, optical microresonators have demonstrated improved power conversion efficiency, making them suitable for large-scale optical systems and supporting transmission speeds of up to 1.84 Pbit/s [5-9]. Additionally, while some advanced approaches combine both techniques to leverage their respective advantages, these hybrid solutions often come at a higher cost. This approach introduces greater complexity and operational costs due to the need for external signals and additional control variables, which can increase energy consumption and phase noise. In contrast, Kerr-based microresonator OFCs offer distinct advantages, such as lower manufacturing costs and operational simplicity. These combs generate a broad and stable spectrum without external modulating sources, which reduces system complexity and noise levels. This is crucial for telecommunications applications that require precision and stability. Furthermore, Kerr-based OFCs have strong potential to dominate OFC generation methods due to their efficiency, robustness, and scalability. Their compatibility with silicon photonics allows for miniaturization and cost-effective manufacturing, making them an attractive option for applications aiming to maximize integration without significantly altering existing network infrastructures [9,10].\", 'Another important aspect of the various comb sources is the power consumption and the wall-plug efficiency, defined by, the ratio of the optical output power of the comb and the associated electrical input power. In this respect, quantitative considerations are only available for few exemplary cases [11,84,85] such that a broad comparison of different comb generation schemes based on commercial devices is not possible. Qualitatively, QD-MLLD seem attractive not only due to their simple operation scheme but also in terms of energy efficiency, converting a DC laser pump current directly into a frequency comb at the output of the device. In comparison to GSLD or EOM-based schemes, this avoids additional RF sources and amplifiers that may easily feature power consumptions of a few watts that come on top of the power consumption of the laser source [11,58]. Moreover, QD-MLLD do not contain any lossy optical coupling interfaces that would decrease the overall efficiency. Regarding KNWG, a very good optical power conversion efficiency of $66\\\\%$ from the seed comb to the broadened comb at the device output is reported [18]. Note, however, that this does not account for generation of the seed comb and that the overall efficiency of KNwG-based comb generators is always worse than that of the underlying seed comb source [84]. For Kerr combs, the main hurdle towards power-efficient operation is the optical conversion efficiency from the CW pump to the comb tones. Reported conversion efficiencies range from less than $1\\\\%$ up to $30\\\\%$ for bright and dark soliton combs, respectively [7,86]. Also here, this figure does not account for the wall-plug efficiency of the CW pump laser, which might need to be complemented by an optical amplifier. Nevertheless, despite the rather low efficiency of the nonlinear conversion process, Kerr comb generators or devices based on spectral broadening in KNWG can reduce the overall power consumption of a WDM transceiver by eliminating the need for individual frequency control of a multitude of CW lasers [84].', 'It has been speculated that a comb source could save a lot of energy in transmitters relying on individual lasers for individual wDM channels. As we have seen in Figure 2 above, a comb source certainly does not produce the same amount of line power as an individual laser does, impairing the achievable OSNR. For long reach links, though, we saw that even for comb powers of less than $^{-20}$ dBm the OSNR penalty was less than 1 dB for more than $1000~\\\\mathrm{km}$ transmission. For short reach, the combs start needing more power to compare to individual lasers. However, even for unrepeatered metro-range transmission, very decent OSNRs may still be obtained for combs, and 661 Tbit/s was experimentally demonstrated feasible over $10\\\\mathrm{km}30$ -core fibre. So combs can offer performance at a reasonable level. Especially, when multiplexing scenarios are considered as a large gain in capacity is obtained for terms outside the $\\\\log_{2}$ in the capacity formula. But can combs be more energy-efficient than single lasers. It is difficult to compare mature commercial solutions to lab-setups. However, there certainly is a potential, as all the comb lines are equidistant and stable, so no additional wavelength locking is required on a per channel basis, and a fewer current sources and laser temperature stabilizers are needed. As mentioned above, this also gives rise to certain digital signal processing benefits, such as joint DSP and nonlinear impairment mitigation. On the other hand, a comb needs a strong pump signal, and amplification of the comb lines, which costs energy. But assuming e.g. replacing 100 s of lasers with a single comb source, as potentially done for the hero experiment reaching 10 Pbit/s transmission [27] using a single source, with all their power sources etc., and knowing that the comb can perform well in some ranges, we expect there would be a considerable savings potential. One essential parameter in this consideration is the pump to line conversion, as this directly impacts the achievable OSNR. This depends on the nonlinear material used, the scheme of comb-generation, and losses in the device.', 'temperature control system was employed, providing enhanced system stability and ensuring long- term crystal preservation. This approach offers a cost- effective and compact solution for thermal management [40]. However, for high- power pump lasers exceeding  $10\\\\mathrm{W}$ , incorporating thermal lens calculations into the cavity design becomes essential to maintain optimal performance. An experimental approach to cavity design was presented, outlining a methodology to effectively translate simulated stability regions and optimal Kerr parameter ranges into practical guidelines for assembly and alignment. Fine- tuning the alignment results in a mode- locked laser generating 61 fs pulses with an average power of  $0.94\\\\mathrm{W}$  and a  $1\\\\mathrm{GHz}$  repetition rate, yielding an approximate pulse energy of  $1\\\\mathrm{nJ}$  and a peak power of  $15\\\\mathrm{kW}$ . By leveraging these design elements, the compact cavity offers a versatile and reliable platform for ultrafast laser applications, with the potential for further improvements and customization. Enhancements such as improved DCM- crystal tuning and integrated pulse compression systems can achieve sub- 10 fs pulses [41]. Additionally, variations such as photonic- circuit- integrated lasers offer advantages of high portability and minimal power consumption [50]. By addressing experimental and practical aspects often not fully detailed in the literature, the alignment and stabilization procedures detailed in this work, combined with the provided tools, discussions, and guidelines, serve as a resource for researchers and engineers seeking to develop high- performance compact cavities in a more time- efficient manner.', 'Here, we report the demonstration of two distinct multi- wavelength, multi- port WDM sources, each formed by coupling the output of an efficient Kerr microcomb device to a monolithically integrated demultiplexer, which autonomously locks to and tracks the comb lines using capacitive optical phase tuning with a zero static power consumption. This work advances large- scale WDM transmitter and receiver systems on a fully monolithic platform, offering certain advantages over hybrid- integrated approaches, such as reduced packaging parasitics and complexity, cost, efficiency, yield, and scalability, all while leveraging reliable CMOS platforms without postprocessing.  \\nIn one design, the Kerr comb device is followed by a Mach- Zehnder interferometer- based wavelength demultiplexer, and in the second design, a ring resonator- based demultiplexer is placed after the Kerr comb output. In both systems, monolithic integration of electronic and photonic devices within the DeMux enables the utilization of capacitive optical phase shifters with zero static power consumption. Both demultiplexers were successfully coupled with the fabricated Kerr comb chip with 200 GHz mode- spacing and  $53\\\\%$  efficiency. By utilizing capacitive tuning with zero static power consumption, a single control unit with a power consumption of  $2.4\\\\mathrm{mW}$  for all phase shifters in a sequential control scheme and an efficient locking and tracking wavelength algorithm, the demonstrated monolithic demultiplexers can potentially achieve a record energy consumption of  $20\\\\mathrm{fJ / b}$  for an 8- channel system at  $16\\\\mathrm{Gb / s}$  per channel, which is reduced to  $10\\\\mathrm{fJ / b}$  for a 8- channel system at  $32\\\\mathrm{Gb / s}$  per channel. If the system is scaled to 32 channels with an aggregate data- rate of  $1\\\\mathrm{Tb / s}$ , the energy consumption is further reduced to  $2.5\\\\mathrm{fJ / bit}$ . The implemented scalable system consumes a fixed amount of energy for the entire system, achieving an increased energy efficiency by more than an order- of- magnitude over existing thermally controlled Mux/DeMux systems, which is further improved as the system is scaled to higher data rates.']}, {'answer': '### 5.2 Economic Viability\\nThe economic viability of Kerr comb-based WDM systems depends on the ability to mass-produce high-quality microresonators and integrate them with other components at a reasonable cost [4].

This adaptation is crucial as it allows the integration of spectrum allocation algorithms with the generation of optical frequency combs (OFCs) using MRR, ensuring efficient and optimal allocation of available spectral resources. In this way, the methodology enhances overall network performance, adapting to the specific needs of each operational scenario.  \\nThe proposed method demonstrates great adaptability by being applicable to any type of optical frequency comb, regardless of the technology used. This is due to the approach's ability to consider key characteristics such as power, optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), and other relevant factors, irrespective of the comb's structure--whether it is a DKS or a constant-line comb. We did not just create an allocation method for a specific comb; we developed a versatile approach that can be applied to various technologies. This adaptability is enabled by cost function constraints that ensure precise and efficient allocation.  \\nThe flexibility of the cost function is one of our most important achievements, as it allows us to prioritize either bandwidth or distance based on the scenario's needs, enhancing the network's adaptability and efficiency. The use of multilevel modulation formats and wavelengths generated by optical microresonators further strengthens the system's ability to effectively adjust to different bandwidth demands.  \\nAlthough the method has a high computational cost, some techniques can speed up the algorithm and reduce this cost, which would significantly increase performance and efficiency in PON networks.

There are two main ways to increase the total transmisson capacity: one is to increase the single-line bitrate with higher order modulation, such as pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signal, and another one is to utilize wavelength division multiplex (WDM). For a high-speed signal larger than 10 Gbaud/s, single side-band (SSB) modulation can alleviate the chromatic dispersion (CD) introduced frequency selective fading and only require the direct detection, which provides much-needed cost-effectiveness. Meanwhile, the guard band between the carrier and side-band can be zero with the advanced signal-to-signal beating interference (ssBI) mitigation technology, such as Kramers-Kronig (KK) receiver, which also enables the CD post-compensation to alleviate the inter-symbol interference [1]. On the other hand, in traditional WDM systems, dozens of cooled lasers increase the system cost and power dissipation. Fortunately, optical frequency combs have been demonstrated for providing multiple laser sources in various optical communication systems, ranging from high-capacity long-haul transmission to cost-efficient short-reach applications. Optical frequency combs can provide large number of optical carriers with fixed and stable channel interval, so as to realize the large scale optical interconnection and maximum transmission capacity [2]. Thanks to the fast development of integrated photonic technology, chip-scale optical frequency comb sources are now available, based on the generation of Kerr frequency comb in optical nonlinear microresonators. Compared with conventional comb sources such as bench-top mode-locked lasers and phase modulator-based comb, uncooled Kerr comb devices feature extremely compact volume, large bandwidth, large comb mode spacing, low power consumption and low noise [3].', \"The implementation of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing has exponentially increased bandwidth demand, which is critical in optical networks, particularly in passive optical networks (PON). In this context, networks using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM-PON) provide a viable solution to enhance transmission capacity. WDM-PON networks offer significant advantages in meeting quality of service (QoS) standards [1], enabling the simultaneous transmission of multiple optical signals over different wavelengths on a single optical fiber. However, their implementation faces economic challenges due to the requirement of installing a laser for each wavelength and achieving phase synchronization. Optical frequency combs (OFCs) present a promising solution, as they are light sources with equally spaced, phase-coherent frequency lines.  \\nIn recent years, numerous cutting-edge methods for generating optical frequency combs (OFCs) have made substantial progress, improving their efficiency and expanding their applicability across various fields. One prominent approach is gain modulation in semiconductor lasers, noted for its simplicity and low cost [2]. This technique leverages the dependence of a semiconductor laser's optical gain on the charge carrier density in its active region. By injecting a variable electric current, the carrier density is altered, which in turn modifies the optical gain, resulting in intensity modulation of the emitted light [3]. Another relevant technique is the use of microcavities, which exploit the interactions between light and mechanical vibrations to produce frequency combs with adjustable bandwidths [4-6].\", 'In quantum key distribution  $\\\\mathrm{(QKD)^{[1 - 4]}}$  , single- frequency lasers are widely used as a light source to generate weak coherent states (WCSs). Going beyond point- to- point QKD, large- scale quantum networks with many users and simultaneous communication links require multi- frequency light sources and wavelength- division multiplexing (WDM) technology to improve communication performance and efficiency. As a direct solution for integrated QKD transceiver chips[5], combining multiple lasers with different wavelengths is experimentally feasible; however, it has substantial challenges in scalability.  \\nIn recent years, the development of manufacturing processes of compact chip- scale microring resonators (MRRs) has provided a more efficient way to acquire highly coherent multi- frequency light such as the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) comb[7] of which the formation is governed by a double- balance of nonlinearity and dispersion, as well as dissipation and gain. The distinctive compact[8], low- noise[9], and low- power consump- . tion[8,10] frequency comb has emerged as a promising light source for a range of technologies[11], including optical clocks[12] optical frequency synthesis[13,14], classical communication[15- 18] and sensing[19,20]. The advent of the optical frequency comb has enabled the provision of a diverse and abundant single- frequency resource with a highly coherent property. The DKS can generate a single optical comb with a high signal- to- noise ratio (SNR) across a broad band  $150 \\\\mathrm{nm})$  , encompassing both C and L bands[21- 24]. The combination of an optical comb with WDM technology represents a crucial step toward the integration and scalability of multi- user quantum networks[25]. The indistinguishability of independent light sources belonging to different users is essential for measurement- device- independent QKD (MDI QKD)[26- 28], which is based on two- photon Hong- OuMandel (HOM) interference[29,30]. Therefore, obtaining highvisibility HOM interference between frequency lines generated from different independent MRRs is highly desirable.']}]\n"

      "{'answer': '## 1. Phase Noise and Stability Challenges\\n\\n### High Phase Noise\\nOne of the primary challenges of Kerr frequency combs is the presence of high phase noise, which arises from the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics within the microcavities. This phase noise can degrade the performance of high-speed data transmission systems, as it leads to increased bit error rates and reduced signal quality. The phase noise is particularly problematic in dense WDM systems where precise frequency stability is critical for maintaining the integrity of individual channels.', 'docs': ['While dense WDM (DWDM) analog coherent links in the Oband benefit from using suppressed-carrier modulation formats, they are not able to exploit some Kerr nonlinearity-mitigating factors present in traditional C-band DWDM coherent systems. For example, in contemporary dispersion-unmanaged C-band DWDM coherent systems, XPM effects are reduced by pulse walk-off [11] and FWM effects are suppressed because dispersion destroys the phase matching between different channels [12]. These systems rely on DSP-based dispersion compensation and nonlinear compensation methods. Similarly, in legacy dispersion-managed C-band DWDM coherent systems, Kerr nonlinearity impairments are mitigated by leaving residual dispersion at the end of each span to break phase matching for FWM [13], while XPM effects can be reduced by engineering the link dispersion profile [14] or introducing time skews between the signal waveforms of different channels [15].  \\nO-band DwDM analog coherent systems, in contrast, cannot exploit fiber dispersion to substantially mitigate Kerr nonlinear effects. Likewise, these systems cannot rely on erbium-doped fiber amplifiers to boost signal power. Managing loss and maintaining sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) therefore become critical design considerations for O-band analog coherent systems in data centers, where ample link budget is required [1].  \\nFrequency combs are increasingly attractive candidates for light sources in WDM data center systems [16]. Comb sources obviate the need for multiple discrete lasers, which can save power needed for laser thermal stabilization [17]. In addition, the phase coherence of comb lines offers opportunities to perform joint phase recovery and reduce complexity at the receiver [18], [19]. Dispersion-unmanaged DWDM coherent transmission in the C-band using comb sources has been demonstrated [20], and is found to outperform transmission using discrete laser sources, as the frequency stability of comb lines maximizes the effectiveness of digital backpropagation for compensating fiber dispersion and Kerr nonlinearity [21]. O-band comb-based coherent transmission using DSP-based transmitter $(\\\\mathrm{Tx})$ and receiver (Rx) signal processing has also been experimentally demonstrated [22].', 'The performance of comb-based WDM systems depends not only on the number and the spacing of the carriers but also on their power as well as on the phase and the amplitude noise. In optical communication systems that rely on advanced modulation formats, the phase of the optical carrier is also used to transmit information, and phase noise may have detrimental effects on the signal quality. Phase noise is usually quantified by the linewidth $\\\\Delta f$ of the carrier as an easy-to-handle figure of merit. Note that this parameter does not reveal the complete statistical characteristics of the phase noise that can, for example, be obtained from the so-called FM noise spectrum [26]. Strictly speaking, the linewidth $\\\\Delta f$ represents the spectral width of a Lorentzian spectral line that is associated with a white frequency-independent FM noise spectrum. It does not account for an increase of the FM noise spectrum towards lower frequencies.  \\nThe impact of phase noise on the data transmission performance depends on the random change of the carrier phase during one optical symbol. Phase noise hence becomes less problematic at shorter symbol durations $T_{\\\\mathrm{s}}$ , that is, higher symbol rates. For a given modulation format and a chosen symbol rate, the linewidth requirements can therefore be expressed by the product of the carrier linewidth $\\\\Delta f$ and the symbol duration $T_{s}$ . To quantify these requirements, the linewidth-induced penalty of the OSNR for a reference bit error ratio (BER) of $10^{-3}$ is considered [27]. In general, the OSNR penalty is specified by the ratio of the OSNR that is actually required to achieve a certain reference BER and the OSNR that would theoretically be required in an ideal transmission setup without phase noise. Table 2.1 specifies the $\\\\Delta f T_{\\\\mathrm{s}}$ product corresponding to a 1 dB OSNR penalty [27]. As expected, higher order modulation formats are less tolerant to phase noise as a higher number of discrete phase states need to be discriminated for correct detection of a symbol.  \\nTable 2.1 Maximum product $\\\\Delta f T_{s}$ of linewidth and symbol duration for different modulation formats, leading to a 1dB optical signal-to-noise power ratio (OsNR) penalty at a reference bit error ratio (BER) of $10^{-3}$ [27].', 'There are several operating regimes of Kerr combs with different noise properties, including primary combs, chaotic combs, and stable soliton combs [16-18]. Primary combs with low noise are initiated by modulation instability of the pump [19]. Chaotic combs are characteristically very noisy due to multiple comb lines oscillating within one resonance [20]. Stable soliton combs with low noise result from the balance between Kerr nonlinearity and anomalous group velocity in the resonant [9-14]. Of interest are low-phase-noise Kerr combs, which have been experimentally demonstrated in multiple microresonator platforms [8-14]. They may present a possible alternative to individual lasers and a potential source for coherent wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission due to the high coherence of the frequency comb. Specifically, a total data capacity of 1.44 Tbit/s using lowphase-noise combs has been demonstrated in coherent communications [2]. A 20 Tbit/s WDM transmission covering the full C and L bands has also been demonstrated based on soliton combs [12]. Optical wavelength multicasting is a potentially important networking function, which copies the same data onto many different output signals for efficient data distribution and parallel processing [21-27]. It appears that microresonator-based Kerr combs could also be a potential tool for wavelength multicasting. However, it remains unclear how Kerr combs with different noise properties affect optical multicasting.  \\nIn this Letter, we describe the experimental investigation of the effect of Kerr combs with different noise properties on the multicasting performance. First, based on the low-phase-noise combs, we demonstrate seven-fold multicasting of a 20 Gbaud quadrature phase-shift-keyed (QPSK) signal to 71.7 GHz spaced copies. Seven generated comb lines are used as sources and input into a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. A constellation diagram with error vector magnitude (EVM) of $16\\\\%$ is achieved when the multicast copies are demodulated. The effect of high noise chaotic combs on the multicasting performance is also studied. It is observed that although wavelength conversion is taking place in the PPLN waveguide for the high-noise comb, the constellation diagrams of the multicast copies are dominated by high-intensity noise.', 'We experimentally demonstrate Kramers-Kronig detection of four 20 Gbaud 16-quadrature-amplitude-modulated (QAM) channels after ${\\\\bf50~\\\\bar{k}m}$ fiber transmission using two soliton Kerr combs as signal sources and local oscillators. The estimated carrier phase at the receiver for each of the channels is relatively similar due to the coherence between the frequency comb lines. The standard deviation of the estimated carrier phase difference of the channels is less than 0.08 rad after $50~\\\\mathrm{km}$ single-mode fiber (SMF) transmission. This enables the carrier phase recovery derived from one channel to be shared among multiple channels. In the back-to-back scenario, the bit error rate (BER) performance for shared carrier phase recovery shows an optical signal-to-noise ratio penalty of ${\\\\sim}\\\\mathbf{0.5}$ dB compared to the BER performance for carrier phase recovery when derived for each channel independently. BERs below the forward error correction threshold are achieved after ${\\\\bf50~k m~}\\\\mathbf{SMF}$ transmission with both independent and shared carrier phase recovery for four 20-Gbaud 16-QAM signals. $\\\\ensuremath{\\\\mathbb{O}}2020$  \\nFor coherent optical receivers, electronic digital signal processing (DSP) is commonly needed to perform carrier phase recovery [1]. In wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) channels, this phase noise estimation tends to be performed for each data channel individually and independently.  \\nRecent reports have shown that carrier phase recovery in conventional intradyne coherent systems can be shared by deriving the phase estimation from one WDM channel and using it for other WDM channels [2,3]. This is achieved by employing mutually coherent lines of two optical frequency combs as both signal sources and local oscillators (LOs) [2,3]. This advance could help to reduce the power consumption for a WDM system.', 'Abstract-We study O-band dense wavelength-division multiplexed (DwDM) analog coherent systems that use either discrete lasers or electro-optic frequency comb generators as transmitter and local oscillator (LO) light sources, considering the effects of fiber Kerr nonlinearity. We study the performance of links using 17 channels at 56 GBaud with 100-GHz spacing, comparing three dual-polarization modulation formats: quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), 8-ary phase-shift keying (8-PSK) and 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM), which achieve aggregate bit rates of 3.4Tb/s, 5.1Tb/s and ${\\\\bf6.8T b/s}$ , respectively, after accounting for forward error-correction overhead. We find that comb systems suffer a 2-dB degradation in signal-to-noise ratio compared to discrete-laser systems from comb processing losses and booster amplification noise, but can still support more than $\\\\mathbf{10km}$ of transmission distance with unallocated loss margins of more than $\\\\mathbf{10dB}$ for QPSK, 7 dB for 8-PSK, and 2 dB for 16-QAM. We find that the achievable transmission distance can depend on timing skew between different channels because of both linear and nonlinear crosstalk. While QPSK comb systems are insensitive to timing skew, 8-PSK and 16-QAM comb systems tolerate maximum timing skews of 0.2 times and 0.1 times the symbol period, respectively, with less than a 1-km penalty on achievable transmission distance.  \\nIndex Terms-Coherent detection, data centers, dense wavelength-division multiplexing, fiber nonlinearity, O-band, optical frequency comb.']}\n"
